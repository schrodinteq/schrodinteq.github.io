<p>Quantum computers, which have been gaining increased attention in recent years, differ from the computers we use in our daily lives. What is the fundamental difference?</p>
<p>The most significant and fundamental difference lies in the bit. Let&rsquo;s refer to the computers we use daily as classical computers. In classical computers, processing is done by assigning each bit a value of either 0 or 1. When discussing quantum computers, the bits used in classical computers are often called classical bits.</p>
<p>When we use computers in our daily lives, we rarely think about the complex processes happening behind the scenes. However, everything from displaying a website to performing complex calculations is made possible by classical computers, which use operations based on 0 and 1. These operations are carried out using logic circuits that combine logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT.</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about quantum computers. In quantum computing, operations are performed using bits called quantum bits instead of classical bits. These quantum bits are also known as qubits. Compared to classical bits, quantum bits have two major differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They can represent a superposition of both 0 and 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can exhibit entanglement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are properties that classical bits do not possess.</p>
<p>　　</p>
<h2 id="quantum-computing-and-quantum-programming">Quantum Computing and Quantum Programming</h2>
<p>The reason quantum computers are attracting attention is that they have the potential to solve specific problems much faster than classical computers by leveraging the unique properties of quantum bits. However, if these quantum bit properties are not utilized, computations on a quantum computer do not necessarily become faster. In other words, running classical algorithms on a quantum computer will not harness the power of quantum bits. To fully realize the potential of quantum computers, it is crucial to design &ldquo;quantum circuits&rdquo; that take advantage of quantum bit properties and develop &ldquo;quantum algorithms&rdquo; based on these circuits.</p>
<p>Research on quantum algorithms is progressing rapidly, with well-known examples including Shor&rsquo;s algorithm (for prime factorization), Grover&rsquo;s algorithm (for database search), and VQC (variational quantum classifier) used for machine learning with quantum computers. These algorithms are expected to leverage the power of quantum computers to provide more efficient solutions to problems that are difficult for classical computers to solve.</p>
<p>Today, SDKs such as Qiskit, Cirq, and Qulacs make it easy for anyone to program and execute quantum algorithms and quantum circuits. This is known as quantum programming. Additionally, professionals who design and implement these algorithms or develop applications for quantum computers are often referred to as quantum engineers.</p>
<p>　　</p>
<p>　　</p>
<h2 id="which-is-superior-classical-computers-or-quantum-computers">Which is superior, classical computers or quantum computers?</h2>
<p>There is often debate about which is superior, classical computers or quantum computers, but the clear answer is that it depends on the problem. For certain problems where quantum bits and quantum algorithms can be effectively utilized, quantum computers have the potential to solve them exponentially faster than classical computers.</p>
<p>However, quantum computers are not superior for all problems. Currently, most problems are still more efficiently solved by classical computers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether classical or quantum computers are better depends significantly on the nature of the problem and the choice of suitable algorithms.</p>

<p>This course is designed for those with no prior knowledge of quantum computing or AWS, and by the end, you&rsquo;ll even be able to learn about quantum machine learning.
Take advantage of this opportunity to build your skills in quantum technologies!</p>
